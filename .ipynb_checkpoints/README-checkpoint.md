## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The data used was from that MLB and the dataset was created by Jay Boice who was responsible for the design and development of the original analysis as well.  According to FiveThirtyEight the dataset containing the Elo (a system used to calculate the skill levels in a zero-sum game) ratings of every team for every game ever played since 1871. Along with the Elo rating of each team, the dataset also contains the name and Elo rating of each starting pitcher and their influence on the probability of each team winning.  Furthermore, the original data that was used to create this sheet was consistently updated based on the result of the game. For example, Clayton Kershaws Elo going into game five of the world series was 1607, however, after leaving the game his Elo jumped to 1610 due to his dominant performance.  The dataset also contains the name of each team and the score of the game that took place for reference.  Overall this is a great dataset that can be used to predict the probability of certain teams winning or losing certain games.
