## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The topic chosen is MLB predictions I am an avid fan of the MLB so I believed it would be extremely interesting to dive into the statistics about each game and the chances of each team winning their supposed game.  I also find it extremely interesting how the starting pitcher for each game can change the prediction outcome allowing a worse team to have a higher chance of winning than a team that by all other means should dominate them. One of the main things I wish to accomplish with this analysis is to see how accurate the predictions in the dataset are and compare them to the real world game that took place. Furthermore, I would love to see how the team's Elo ratings increased or decreased to teams trading players or winning games that they were predicted to lose. 

I believe I can create a user-facing dashboard with this specific dashboard. I have multiple options on how to showcase the data from games played and a final score of the game in relation to the prediction made.  I will explore every option while deciphering the dataset which should be a good time as I have very keen on learning the majority of what the dataset can show me.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The data used was from that MLB and the dataset was created by Jay Boice who was responsible for the design and development of the original analysis as well.  According to FiveThirtyEight the dataset containing the Elo (a system used to calculate the skill levels in a zero-sum game) ratings of every team for every game ever played since 1871. Along with the Elo rating of each team, the dataset also contains the name and Elo rating of each starting pitcher and their influence on the probability of each team winning.  Furthermore, the original data that was used to create this sheet was consistently updated based on the result of the game. For example, Clayton Kershaws Elo going into game five of the world series was 1607, however, after leaving the game his Elo jumped to 1610 due to his dominant performance.  The dataset also contains the name of each team and the score of the game that took place for reference.  Overall this is a great dataset that can be used to predict the probability of certain teams winning or losing certain games.
